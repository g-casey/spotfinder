Spotify sign in is currently only working for selected members as spotify must approve the application. 

Backend is built with Spring MVC and frontend with tailwind css, alpine.js, and htmx. 

Alpine.js frontend is currently very messy and poorly written.  Will be migrating frontend to React eventually.
